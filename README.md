# MEVN-Full-stack-CRUD-Panel

This project has been made with the help of the Kotron team.
Video link of the original reference material: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8zEdgyfKuM&t=886s
The project is a MEVN application that runs a CRUD user panel that adds/edits/delets users. Besides the material shown in the video the users were given more parameters when they are created and a validation sistem has been added to the add/edit form.
In this depository there is also a .docx I wrote that describes the code writen in the application and all of its packages and dependencies .

Running this aplication yarn package manager or something similar is necesery.

To run this project first you have to enter into the apis and app folders seperatly and using the terminal run the yarn command "yarn install".
In thee apis/development.env change the port number to 4000.
Using the terminal in the apis and app folder start the application by running the command "yarn start" simultaniously and enter the localhost link that appears in the app terminal.
